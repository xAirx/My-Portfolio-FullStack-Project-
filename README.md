# Development Notes  



 ## React website (Frontend)

#### Notes: 



onenote: https://d.docs.live.net/0897203c158e872f/Documents/marcos%20notesbog/MERN%20stack/
                

     Frontend built in React.js, supporting react router based on Redux.
     Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the information from the server and update the Redux store.

   


  #### Part 1 & 2 :

      Setting up the project &. Creating components needed - done
      
      Created a new DishdetailComponent and added it to React application. - done
    
      Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the details of the selected dish using an reactstrap card component. - done
    
      Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the list of comments about the dish using the Bootstrap unstyled list component. - done
    
      Integrated the AboutComponent given above into the single page application. - done
    
      Added a new functional component named <RenderLeader> through the RenderLeader() function to AboutComponent.js that    renders the details of a given leader using the reactstrap <Media> component. - done
      
    Construct and render the list of leaders in the About Us page using the <RenderLeader> component implemented above. - done


#### Part 3:

      Configure The React application to make use of Redux   - done
       
      Provide a form to enable users to submit their comments   - done
      
      Validate the information entered by the users in the form   - done
    
      Set up the form as a local form using the react-redux-form    - done


​      

 #### Part 4 : 

       Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the leaders information from the server and update the Redux store.
    
        Updated the Home and the About component to render the information about the leaders using the downloaded data from the server
    
        Add simple animations to the About component where the leaders information is displayed.
    
        Enabled the users to submit feedback through the feedback form by creating a new feedback service that accepts the form data and uses Restangular to record their feedback on the server.

 


     Appropriate action types and action creators have been added.
    The Home component is correctly using the leader data, and handling any errors that might arise.
    The About component is correctly using the leader data, and handling any errors that might arise.


    A new postFeedback() action creator is correctly implemented to post the feedback data to the server.
    The Contact component has been correctly updated to use postFeedback() to post the form data to the server.


    Appropriate animation has been added to stagger the rendering of the leaders in the AboutComponent.

    * Decide on the database schemas and the structure of the data, depending upon the database technology to implement the persistence of server-side data  - done
    
    * Design the business logic to be implemented on the server-side to support the needs of the front-end.  - done


    * Implemented the Promotions schema and model - done
    
    * Implement a REST API to support the /promotions endpoint, and the /promotions/:promoId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database  - done
    
    * Implemented the Leaders schema and model  - done
    
    * Implement a REST API to support the /leaders endpoint, and the /leaders/:leaderId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database - done


    Task 1 - done
    * The Promotions schema and model correctly supports all the fields as per the example document given above - done
    * The label field is set to an empty string by default - done
    * The price schema is be supported with a new SchemaType called Currency. - done
    * The REST API endpoints /promotions and /promotions/:promoId are implemented to interact with the MongoDB database - done

   ###### Part 3 :

    User Authentication
    
    * Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges.
    * Allow any one to perform GET operations
    * Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
    * Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database
    * Allow a registered user to submit comments (already completed), update a submitted comment and delete a submitted comment. The user should be restricted to perform such operations only on his/her own comments. No user or even the Admin can edit or delete the comments submitted by other users.


     update all the routes in the REST API to ensure that only the Admins can perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Update the code for all the    routers to support this. These operations should be supported for the following end points:


    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /products and /products/:dishId
    * DELETE operation on /products/:dishId/comments
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /promotions and /promotions/:promoId
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /leaders and /leaders/:leaderId




   ##### Part 4 : 

    Backend as a service


    * Allowed users to select a dish as their favorite, and add it to the list of favorites that are saved on the server.
    * Allowed users to retrieve the list of their favorite products from the server
    * Delete one or all of their favorite products from their favorites list on the server.


    * When the user does a GET operation on '/favorites',   populate the user information and the products information before returning the favorites to the user.
    * When the user does a POST operation on '/favorites' by including [{"_id":"dish ObjectId"}, . . ., {"_id":"dish ObjectId"}] in the body of the message,   (a) create a favorite document if such a document corresponding to this user does not already exist in the system, (b) add the products specified in the body of the message to the list of favorite products for the user, if the products do not already exists in the list of favorites.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites',  delete the list of favorites corresponding to the user, by deleting the favorite document corresponding to this user from the collection.
    * When the user performs a POST operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then   add the specified dish to the list of the user's list of favorite products, if the dish is not already in the list of favorite products.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then  remove the specified dish from the list of the user's list of favorite products.


    * A new favoriteSchema and Favorites model has been correctly implemented to take advantage of Mongoose Population support to track the users and the list of favorite products using their ObjectIds in the favoriteSchema and Favorites model.
    * The GET, POST and DELETE operations are well supported as per the specifications above
    * The app.js has been updated to support the new route.

​      

#### Part 4:  Calendar event API, Image Picker API Reservation Functionality with users calendar.

   In this task will make use of the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable application to fetch an image from the photo library.

       Update LoginComponent.js to set up a function named getImageFromGallery() that fetches the image from the photo library on the device using the ImagePicker API support. Details of setting up the source to be the Photo Library can be found in the API documentation.
       Add a new button named Gallery that when clicked will initiate the process to enable the user to select a picture from the photo library using the ImagePicker API.
       Once the image is picked, it must be processed through the ImageManipulator to obtain a resized PNG version of the image as we did in the exercise.

   


In this task I will insert a new Calendar event into the default calendar on the mobile device for the table reservation.  will use the Calendar API from Expo SDK for this.  will implement this in the ReservationComponent.js file.

       When the user submits the reservation form,  will obtain the details of the reservation in the handleReservation() function.
       Implement a new function named obtainCalendarPermission() that will ask for permission to access the calendar on the device. The corresponding permission is Permission.CALENDAR.
       Implement another function named addReservationToCalendar() that receives the date information as a parameter. This function is invoked from the handleReservation() function.
    
      should use the createEventAsync() function from the Calendar API to insert the event into the default calendar (Calendar.DEFAULT). This function takes a title, the start and end time, timezone and location as the parameters.
       Use 'Con Fusion Table Reservation' as the title of the inserted event
    
       To specify the start Date and end Date,  can convert the Date ISO string into a Date object by using new Date(Date.parse(date)). Furthermore, the Date.parse() gives  the date value in milliseconds.  can set up the end time by adding 2 hours (2*60*60*1000) to the milliseconds and use it to generate the Date object corresponding to the end time of the event.
    
       For time zone use 'Asia/Hong_Kong', and the location as '121, Clear Water Bay Road, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong'


       The LoginComponent.js is updated to implement the getImageFromGallery() function that uses the ImagePicker API to enable the fetching of the image from the photo library.
    
       The LoginComponent.js file is updated to include a button named Gallery that will initiate the procedure to enable the user to select a picture from the photo gallery.


       The image selected by the user is processed using the ImageManipulator to generate a PNG image


       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the obtainCalendarPermission() function that obtains permission to access the calendar
    
       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the addReservationToCalendar() function that inserts the event into the default calendar using the Calendar API.
    
       The details of the event are correctly inserted setting the title, start and end time and the location correctly.
