# My Portfolio FullStack Project 
 
# Project created as part of the honors programme at the hong kong universty of science and technology.

 
 
### The project will combine all three courses:

          Front-End Web Development with React 
          Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB
          Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native

 ### Introduction
                
                A website + native app “Boilerplate” 
                with a backend and Native app that serves as a platform for showing any content you would like could be a       petstore, a football club, anything you would like.

                User login and authentication
                Authentication based on being an admin or not.
                Admin based management, being able to see a user list, and the entire API.
                Comment and form support for the users to interact with the content.
                    Support for a user to manage their own comments, delete functionality.
                    API supporting various objects of which contains members of the “company” 
                    A React Native app, supporting the same features working with the same backend and API.

                Immidiate Architechture (Subject to change)

 ### Frontend 
                
                Frontend built in React.js, supporting react router based on Redux.
                Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the information from the server and update the Redux store.

                Updated the Home and the About component to render the information using the downloaded data from the server

                Add simple animations to the About component where the information is displayed.
                Provide a form to enable users to submit their comments

                Validate the information entered by the users in the form

                Enabled the users to submit feedback through the feedback form by creating a new feedback service that accepts the form data and uses Restangular to record their feedback on the server.
                Includes UI design and prototyping 


 ### User Authentication
                
                •	Allowed users to select a dish as their favorite, and add it to the list of favorites that are saved on the server.
                Allowed users to retrieve the list of their favorite dishes from the server
                Delete one or all of their favorite dishes from their favorites list on the server.
                Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges.
                Allow any one to perform GET operations
                Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
                Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database
                Allow a registered user to submit comments (already completed), update a submitted comment and delete a submitted comment. The user should be restricted to perform such operations only on his/her own comments. No user or even the Admin can edit or delete the comments submitted by other users.

### React Native
                
                A Smaller version of the website as a native app, using the same ideation for authentication, redux integration and backend as our “frontend  website” – 
                Includes UI design and prototyping for the Native app.

 ### Backend 
                
                (BAAS) and  A Rest API with Express MongoDB & Mongoose.
                REST API that should be supported by my server-side. 
                Deciding on the database schemas based on mongooseand the structure of the data
                To Design the business logic to be implemented on the server-side to support the needs of the front-end.
                A new schema and model will be correctly implemented to take advantage of Mongoose Population support to track  data within the app using their ObjectIds in the schema and the supported model.
                The GET, POST and DELETE operations are well supported as per the specifications above 
                – The details of these crud operations will be defined in later editions of this report.
