     Frontend built in React.js, supporting react router based on Redux.
     Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the information from the server and update the Redux store.
   
   
   
  #### Part 1 & 2 :
      
      Setting up the project &. Creating components needed - done
      
      Created a new DishdetailComponent and added it to React application. - done

      Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the details of the selected dish using an reactstrap card component. - done

      Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the list of comments about the dish using the Bootstrap unstyled list component. - done

      Integrated the AboutComponent given above into the single page application. - done

      Added a new functional component named <RenderLeader> through the RenderLeader() function to AboutComponent.js that    renders the details of a given leader using the reactstrap <Media> component. - done
      
    Construct and render the list of leaders in the About Us page using the <RenderLeader> component implemented above. - done
      

#### Part 3:
      
      Configure The React application to make use of Redux
      
      Provide a form to enable users to submit their comments
      
      Validate the information entered by the users in the form

      Set up the form as a local form using the react-redux-form 
      
           import { DISHES } from '../shared/dishes';
           import { COMMENTS } from '../shared/comments';
           import { PROMOTIONS } from '../shared/promotions';
           import { LEADERS } from '../shared/leaders';

           export const initialState = {
               dishes: DISHES,
               comments: COMMENTS,
               promotions: PROMOTIONS,
               leaders: LEADERS
           };

           export const Reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
               return state;
           };

      
 #### Part 4 : 
 
       Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the leaders information from the server and update the Redux store.

        Updated the Home and the About component to render the information about the leaders using the downloaded data from the server

        Add simple animations to the About component where the leaders information is displayed.

        Enabled the users to submit feedback through the feedback form by creating a new feedback service that accepts the form data and uses Restangular to record their feedback on the server.

 
     Appropriate action types and action creators have been added.
    The Home component is correctly using the leader data, and handling any errors that might arise.
    The About component is correctly using the leader data, and handling any errors that might arise.


    A new postFeedback() action creator is correctly implemented to post the feedback data to the server.
    The Contact component has been correctly updated to use postFeedback() to post the form data to the server.


    Appropriate animation has been added to stagger the rendering of the leaders in the AboutComponent.

   #### Express and Routing

   #####  Part 1 :

    * Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the dishes REST API. - done
    * Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the promotions REST API. -done 
    * Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the leaders REST API. -done 

    Objective 1 

    * The REST API supports GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on /dishes/:dishId end point. -done 

    Objective 2 

    * The new Node module, promoRouter is implemented and used to support the /promotions end point. -done 
    * The REST API supports GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on /promotions and GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on /promotions/:promoId end points. -done 


    Objective 3 

    * The new Node module, leaderRouter is implemented and used to support the /leaders end point. -done 
    * The REST API supports GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on /leadership and GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on /leaders/:leaderId end points. -done



   ###### Part 2 : 

    Architecture and REST API and endpoints.

    Objectives:

    * Designing the overall architecture of application, from the front-end to the back-end.  apportioned the responsibilities to the front-end and back-end.

    * Design an appropriate REST API that should be supported by server-side. A good design would enable ease of implementation of both the front-end and the back-end and facilitate seamless communication.

    * Decide on the database schemas and the structure of the data, depending upon the database technology to implement the persistence of server-side data

    * Design the business logic to be implemented on the server-side to support the needs of the front-end.


    * Implemented the Promotions schema and model

    * Implement a REST API to support the /promotions endpoint, and the /promotions/:promoId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database

    * Implemented the Leaders schema and model

    * Implement a REST API to support the /leaders endpoint, and the /leaders/:leaderId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database


    Task 1
    * The Promotions schema and model correctly supports all the fields as per the example document given above
    * The label field is set to an empty string by default
    * The price schema is be supported with a new SchemaType called Currency.
    * The REST API endpoints /promotions and /promotions/:promoId are implemented to interact with the MongoDB database

    Task 2
    * The Leaders schema and model correctly supports all the fields as per the example document given above.
    * The REST API endpoints /leaders and /leaders/:leaderId are implemented to interact with the MongoDB database




   ###### Part 3 :

    User Authentication

    * Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges.
    * Allow any one to perform GET operations
    * Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
    * Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database
    * Allow a registered user to submit comments (already completed), update a submitted comment and delete a submitted comment. The user should be restricted to perform such operations only on his/her own comments. No user or even the Admin can edit or delete the comments submitted by other users.


     update all the routes in the REST API to ensure that only the Admins can perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Update the code for all the    routers to support this. These operations should be supported for the following end points:


    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /dishes and /dishes/:dishId
    * DELETE operation on /dishes/:dishId/comments
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /promotions and /promotions/:promoId
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /leaders and /leaders/:leaderId




   ##### Part 4 : 

    Backend as a service


    * Allowed users to select a dish as their favorite, and add it to the list of favorites that are saved on the server.
    * Allowed users to retrieve the list of their favorite dishes from the server
    * Delete one or all of their favorite dishes from their favorites list on the server.


    * When the user does a GET operation on '/favorites',   populate the user information and the dishes information before returning the favorites to the user.
    * When the user does a POST operation on '/favorites' by including [{"_id":"dish ObjectId"}, . . ., {"_id":"dish ObjectId"}] in the body of the message,   (a) create a favorite document if such a document corresponding to this user does not already exist in the system, (b) add the dishes specified in the body of the message to the list of favorite dishes for the user, if the dishes do not already exists in the list of favorites.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites',  delete the list of favorites corresponding to the user, by deleting the favorite document corresponding to this user from the collection.
    * When the user performs a POST operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then   add the specified dish to the list of the user's list of favorite dishes, if the dish is not already in the list of favorite dishes.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then  remove the specified dish from the list of the user's list of favorite dishes.


    * A new favoriteSchema and Favorites model has been correctly implemented to take advantage of Mongoose Population support to track the users and the list of favorite dishes using their ObjectIds in the favoriteSchema and Favorites model.
    * The GET, POST and DELETE operations are well supported as per the specifications above
    * The app.js has been updated to support the new route.




# React Native 

The Native app is a mini version of the above React Frontend. 

The Native app will also be using the API and Backend created.

The app also includes table reservation, with integration with the users calendar.


#### Part 1 : Navigators and Components. - done

    The Contact Us page is showing the address of the restaurant in the card format as shown above. - done

       The history information about the restaurant is displayed in a card format as shown above using a functional component named History(). - done

       The ContactComponent is a included using the Stack Navigator and in the Drawer Navigator. - done

 
#### Part 2 : UI elements and Redux

      Add an Action named ADD_COMMENT to the ActionTypes.js.
      
      Add two action creators named postComment() and addComment(). The postComment() creator will receive the dishId, rating, author and comment as the four parameters. 
      
      Update the comments reducer function to handle the new ADD_COMMENT action and add the comment to the list of comments. The handling of the action should also ensure that appropriate ID will be added to the comment.


      The modal containing the form is correctly added to the DIshdetail component
      The form is correctly configured with the rating, author and comment fields.
      An Icon is added to the RenderDish Card that will trigger the showing of the modal.

      The ADD_COMMENT action is correctly added
      The postComment() action creator is correctly added
      The addComment() action creator is correctly added and will be dispatched by postComment() after a 2 sec delay
      The comment reducer is updated to handle the ADD_COMMENT action

    
#### Part 3: Animations, gestures and redux persist.

     The reservation form zooms in when the user navigates to the reservation view


    An alert containing the information from the reservation form is shown when the user submits the filled reservation form.
    If the user clicks on Cancel, then the form is cleared.
    If the user clicks on OK, then the form is cleared.


    When the user does a left to right gesture on the Dish details card in the Dishdetail component, toggle the comment form modal.

      
      
#### part 4:  Calendar event API, Image Picker API Reservation Functionality with users calendar.

   In this task will make use of the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable application to fetch an image from the photo library.

       Update LoginComponent.js to set up a function named getImageFromGallery() that fetches the image from the photo library on the device using the ImagePicker API support. Details of setting up the source to be the Photo Library can be found in the API documentation.
       Add a new button named Gallery that when clicked will initiate the process to enable the user to select a picture from the photo library using the ImagePicker API.
       Once the image is picked, it must be processed through the ImageManipulator to obtain a resized PNG version of the image as we did in the exercise.

   
   In this task will insert a new Calendar event into the default calendar on the mobile device for the table reservation.  will use the Calendar API from Expo SDK for this.  will implement this in the ReservationComponent.js file.

       When the user submits the reservation form,  will obtain the details of the reservation in the handleReservation() function.
       Implement a new function named obtainCalendarPermission() that will ask for permission to access the calendar on the device. The corresponding permission is Permission.CALENDAR.
       Implement another function named addReservationToCalendar() that receives the date information as a parameter. This function is invoked from the handleReservation() function.

      should use the createEventAsync() function from the Calendar API to insert the event into the default calendar (Calendar.DEFAULT). This function takes a title, the start and end time, timezone and location as the parameters.
       Use 'Con Fusion Table Reservation' as the title of the inserted event

       To specify the start Date and end Date,  can convert the Date ISO string into a Date object by using new Date(Date.parse(date)). Furthermore, the Date.parse() gives  the date value in milliseconds.  can set up the end time by adding 2 hours (2*60*60*1000) to the milliseconds and use it to generate the Date object corresponding to the end time of the event.

       For time zone use 'Asia/Hong_Kong', and the location as '121, Clear Water Bay Road, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong'


       The LoginComponent.js is updated to implement the getImageFromGallery() function that uses the ImagePicker API to enable the fetching of the image from the photo library.

       The LoginComponent.js file is updated to include a button named Gallery that will initiate the procedure to enable the user to select a picture from the photo gallery.


       The image selected by the user is processed using the ImageManipulator to generate a PNG image


       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the obtainCalendarPermission() function that obtains permission to access the calendar

       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the addReservationToCalendar() function that inserts the event into the default calendar using the Calendar API.

       The details of the event are correctly inserted setting the title, start and end time and the location correctly.
