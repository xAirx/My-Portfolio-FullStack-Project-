 ## Component Testing is backed up by Storybook.js
   
   	Small explanation: 
	
	https://blog.logrocket.com/react-storybook/
	
	
   
                    Storybook.js is a tool that helps writing components in isolation, and showcase them interactively in an isolated dev environment. 

	            The idea is to isolate show its behavior in a series of tests. This way we can make sure it works.
			
		    Storybook offers different techniques for testing UI components. Components need to undergo tests for a variety of reasons some of which are:

		    Detection of bugs
		    Tests can be documented to serve as guidelines for other developers who will work on the project
		    To prevent stuff from breaking during new commits
