 ## Component Testing is backed up by Storybook.js
   
   	Small explanation: 
	
	https://blog.logrocket.com/react-storybook/
	
	
   
                    Storybook.js is a tool that helps writing components in isolation, and showcase them interactively in an isolated dev environment. 

	            The idea is to isolate show its behavior in a series of tests. This way we can make sure it works.
			
		    Storybook offers different techniques for testing UI components. Components need to undergo tests for a variety of reasons some of which are:

		    Detection of bugs
		    Tests can be documented to serve as guidelines for other developers who will work on the project
		    To prevent stuff from breaking during new commits
		    
   
   
   ## Simple Devops Setup 
                                      

	Simple Devops Setup. (Roughly)

	 Dev -> pre hook ->  Github -> CI/CD (gitlab) 
	  ->  Staging Unit-testing // Storybook Js (Component isolation and  Testing)                                                                                                                                   		->  Build stage   (Project build (minifying etc happens here))
	  ->  Deployed to ***** -> (Live in production) 

	Sentry and Logrocket monitoring 
	-> Integration with github, bugfixes with case idâ€™s devbranch 
	-> master
	-> trigger devops setup above.

#### Part 2 : UI elements and Redux - done

       Add an Action named ADD_COMMENT to the ActionTypes.js. - done

       Add two action creators named postComment() and addComment(). The postComment() creator will receive the dishId, rating, author and comment as the four parameters. - done

      Update the comments reducer function to handle the new ADD_COMMENT action and add the comment to the list of comments. The handling of the action should also ensure that appropriate ID will be added to the comment.- done


     The modal containing the form is correctly added to the Dishdetail component- done

     The form is correctly configured with the rating, author and comment fields.- done

     An Icon is added to the RenderDish Card that will trigger the showing of the modal.- done

      The ADD_COMMENT action is correctly added- done

      The postComment() action creator is correctly added- done

      The addComment() action creator is correctly added and will be dispatched by postComment() after a 2 sec delay- done

      The comment reducer is updated to handle the ADD_COMMENT action- done

      EXTRA: __________________________________________________________________

      The favorites redux integration now includes a toggle functionality.- done

#### Part 3: Animations, gestures and redux persist. - done


     The reservation form zooms in when the user navigates to the reservation view - done 


      An alert containing the information from the reservation form is shown when the user submits the filled reservation form. - done 
          If the user clicks on Cancel, then the form is cleared. - done 
          If the user clicks on OK, then the form is cleared. - done 


     When the user does a left to right gesture on the Dish details card in the Dishdetail component, toggle the comment form modal. - done
     

#### Part 4:  Calendar event API, Image Picker API Reservation Functionality with users calendar.- done

        In this task will make use of the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable application to fetch an image from the photo library.

          Update LoginComponent.js to set up a function named getImageFromGallery() that fetches the image from the photo library on the device using the ImagePicker API support.


         Details of setting up the source to be the Photo Library can be found in the API documentation.- done

         Add a new button named Gallery that when clicked will initiate the process to enable the user to select a picture from the photo library using the ImagePicker API.- done

          Once the image is picked, it must be processed through the ImageManipulator to obtain a resized PNG version of the image as we did in the exercise.- done

        In this task I will insert a new Calendar event into the default calendar on the mobile device for the table reservation.  will use the Calendar API from Expo SDK for this.  will implement this in the ReservationComponent.js file.

        When the user submits the reservation form,  will obtain the details of the reservation in the handleReservation() function.- done

          Implement a new function named obtainCalendarPermission() that will ask for permission to access the calendar on the device. The corresponding permission is Permission.CALENDAR.

         Implement another function named addReservationToCalendar() that receives the date information as a parameter. This function is invoked from the handleReservation() function.- done

         should use the createEventAsync() function from the Calendar API to insert the event into the default calendar (Calendar.DEFAULT). This function takes a title, the start and end time, timezone and location as the parameters.

        Use 'Con Fusion Table Reservation' as the title of the inserted event- done

        To specify the start Date and end Date,  can convert the Date ISO string into a Date object by using new Date(Date.parse(date)). Furthermore, the Date.parse() gives  the date value in milliseconds.  can set up the end time by adding 2 hours (2*60*60*1000) to the milliseconds and use it to generate the Date object corresponding to the end time of the event.- done

         For time zone use 'Asia/Hong_Kong', and the location as '121, Clear Water Bay Road, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong' - done

         The LoginComponent.js is updated to implement the getImageFromGallery() function that uses the ImagePicker API to enable the fetching of the image from the photo library. - done

        The LoginComponent.js file is updated to include a button named Gallery that will initiate the procedure to enable the user to select a picture from the photo gallery. - done

         The image selected by the user is processed using the ImageManipulator to generate a PNG image - done

        The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the obtainCalendarPermission() function that obtains permission to access the calendar - done

         The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the addReservationToCalendar() function that inserts the event into the default calendar using the Calendar API.- done

        The details of the event are correctly inserted setting the title, start and end time and the location correctly. - done
