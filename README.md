 ## Component Testing is backed up by Storybook.js
   
   	Small explanation: 
	
	https://blog.logrocket.com/react-storybook/
	
	
   
                    Storybook.js is a tool that helps writing components in isolation, and showcase them interactively in an isolated dev environment. 

	            The idea is to isolate show its behavior in a series of tests. This way we can make sure it works.
			
		    Storybook offers different techniques for testing UI components. Components need to undergo tests for a variety of reasons some of which are:

		    Detection of bugs
		    Tests can be documented to serve as guidelines for other developers who will work on the project
		    To prevent stuff from breaking during new commits
		    
  


# Project overview


   ## App made in React Native 

    __________________________________
    
     A React Native app, supporting the same features working with the same backend and API.
     
     The App depicts an app for a restaurant, with several features such as user login, table booking, and other native features created and utilized with the EXPO CLI, for example: integration with the users calendar.
     an API was written in express (mongoose, mongodb). 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   ### Goals: 

     Summarize the salient features of hybrid mobile application development frameworks
     Create a React Native application
     Develop a React Native application using various React Native components and Layouts
     Build navigation within your application using React Native Navigation support
     
     Design the UI for the app using various React Native UI elements
     Express the Redux approach to implementing a variant of the Flow architecture in React Native
     Design forms within the application for data entry
     Employ alerts and Modals to present information to the user
     
     Build storage support within the application for persisting Redux state
     Employ animations to provide enhanced user experience
     Employ gesture-based interaction within the app
     Develop a way of alerting users
     
     Develop applications to use the native capabilities of the devices
     Employ the Expo SDK to access native device capabilities
     Develop applications that use sharing features of mobile devices
     Develop applications that can do user notifications
