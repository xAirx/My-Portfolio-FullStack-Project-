## A quick TLDR overview.

  ##### This is described in depth in the architecture section / development notes section below.

#### 

        The project consists of an app and a website depicting a restaurant.

        Redux managing data from the API distributing it across the app.
        
        The data consists of leaders, dishes, and promotions, this data makes up the content on the webpage and app.
        
        Users can register and login   
        
        The registration functionality is extended in the app which includes integration with the devices camera and camera roll.
        
        Users are able to favorite and comment on dishes.
        
        Users are able to see their favorites and also delete them.
     
        The app includes a table reservation system that also communicates with redux and native elements on the devices, such as calendar and notification 
        
        

        Login functionality, with registration, JWT, communicating with the backend express API. 
        Oauth, facebook login etc.

        Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges



        Frontend integration and communicating with the  Backend to make this happen.

        ////////// Admin panel assignment //////////////////////////////////////////////////////


        Allow on backend and enable on frontend:


        Redirect from login to admin panel 

        Admin allowed / able to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
        
        Admin recieves popup alert before deletion is completed. "Warning"

#### Part 4:  Calendar event API, Image Picker API Reservation Functionality with users calendar.- done

   In this task will make use of the Expo SDK ImagePicker API to enable application to fetch an image from the photo library.

       Update LoginComponent.js to set up a function named getImageFromGallery() that fetches the image from the photo library on the device using the ImagePicker API support. Details of setting up the source to be the Photo Library can be found in the API documentation.- done
       Add a new button named Gallery that when clicked will initiate the process to enable the user to select a picture from the photo library using the ImagePicker API.- done
       Once the image is picked, it must be processed through the ImageManipulator to obtain a resized PNG version of the image as we did in the exercise.- done



    In this task I will insert a new Calendar event into the default calendar on the mobile device for the table reservation.  will use the Calendar API from Expo SDK for this.  will implement this in the ReservationComponent.js file.

       When the user submits the reservation form,  will obtain the details of the reservation in the handleReservation() function.- done
       Implement a new function named obtainCalendarPermission() that will ask for permission to access the calendar on the device. The corresponding permission is Permission.CALENDAR.
       Implement another function named addReservationToCalendar() that receives the date information as a parameter. This function is invoked from the handleReservation() function.- done
    
      should use the createEventAsync() function from the Calendar API to insert the event into the default calendar (Calendar.DEFAULT). This function takes a title, the start and end time, timezone and location as the parameters.
       Use 'Con Fusion Table Reservation' as the title of the inserted event- done
    
       To specify the start Date and end Date,  can convert the Date ISO string into a Date object by using new Date(Date.parse(date)). Furthermore, the Date.parse() gives  the date value in milliseconds.  can set up the end time by adding 2 hours (2*60*60*1000) to the milliseconds and use it to generate the Date object corresponding to the end time of the event.- done
    
       For time zone use 'Asia/Hong_Kong', and the location as '121, Clear Water Bay Road, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong' - done

       The LoginComponent.js is updated to implement the getImageFromGallery() function that uses the ImagePicker API to enable the fetching of the image from the photo library. - done
    
       The LoginComponent.js file is updated to include a button named Gallery that will initiate the procedure to enable the user to select a picture from the photo gallery. - done

       The image selected by the user is processed using the ImageManipulator to generate a PNG image - done

       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the obtainCalendarPermission() function that obtains permission to access the calendar - done
       
       The ReservationComponent.js file is modified to implement the addReservationToCalendar() function that inserts the event into the default calendar using the Calendar API.- done
    
    The details of the event are correctly inserted setting the title, start and end time and the location correctly. - done



#### Part 5: Login registration and authentication.

    Connecting the login system to the backend, allowing users to login and register.
    Based on the user being admin or not, the user will either be redirected to home or an admin panel.
    
     /////////// ADMIN Operations ////////////

   ###### Part 3 :

    User Authentication
    
    * Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges.
    * Allow any one to perform GET operations
    * Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations
    * Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database
    * Allow a registered user to submit comments (already completed), update a submitted comment and delete a submitted comment. The user should be restricted to perform such operations only on his/her own comments. No user or even the Admin can edit or delete the comments submitted by other users.


     update all the routes in the REST API to ensure that only the Admins can perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Update the code for all the    routers to support this. These operations should be supported for the following end points:


    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /products and /products/:dishId
    * DELETE operation on /products/:dishId/comments
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /promotions and /promotions/:promoId
    * POST, PUT and DELETE operations on /leaders and /leaders/:leaderId




   ##### Part 4 : 

    Backend as a service


    * Allowed users to select a dish as their favorite, and add it to the list of favorites that are saved on the server.
    * Allowed users to retrieve the list of their favorite products from the server
    * Delete one or all of their favorite products from their favorites list on the server.


    * When the user does a GET operation on '/favorites',   populate the user information and the products information before returning the favorites to the user.
    * When the user does a POST operation on '/favorites' by including [{"_id":"dish ObjectId"}, . . ., {"_id":"dish ObjectId"}] in the body of the message,   (a) create a favorite document if such a document corresponding to this user does not already exist in the system, (b) add the products specified in the body of the message to the list of favorite products for the user, if the products do not already exists in the list of favorites.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites',  delete the list of favorites corresponding to the user, by deleting the favorite document corresponding to this user from the collection.
    * When the user performs a POST operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then   add the specified dish to the list of the user's list of favorite products, if the dish is not already in the list of favorite products.
    * When the user performs a DELETE operation on '/favorites/:dishId', then  remove the specified dish from the list of the user's list of favorite products.


    * A new favoriteSchema and Favorites model has been correctly implemented to take advantage of Mongoose Population support to track the users and the list of favorite products using their ObjectIds in the favoriteSchema and Favorites model.
    * The GET, POST and DELETE operations are well supported as per the specifications above
    * The app.js has been updated to support the new route.
